# Code and data for Kathmandu & Kavre, Nepal HEV serological cohort study

This repository contains the code and data associated with the manuscript _“Hepatitis E Virus in the Kathmandu Valley: Insights from a Representative Longitudinal Serosurvey”_. 


The data is located in the data folder in two formats, as a CSV and RMD file. 

The file _"HEV_TablesFigures_GitHub.Rmd"_ will generate the tables and figures in the manscript except for the map. 

Please note, to protect human subjects data:

* We have not included household GPS coordinates in the publicly available data
* We have rounded age to the nearest year, so, if re-generated, results of age-specific analyses could vary slightly from those in the manuscript.
