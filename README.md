# Code and data for Kathmandu & Kavre, Nepal HEV serological cohort study

This repository contains the code and data associated with the manuscript _“Hepatitis E Virus in the Kathmandu Valley: Insights from a Representative Longitudinal Serosurvey”_. 

The data and code should be sufficient to reproduce analyses detailed in the manuscript and Supplementary Materials with the following exceptions:

* We have not included household GPS coordinates in the publicly available data
* We have rounded age to the nearest year to protect date of birth information, so, if re-generated, results of age-binned analyses could vary slightly from those in the manuscript.
